# Radix Sort

## Part 1: Sorting Algorithms
Convert the radix sort algorithm that is described in the Appendix section to Java program. Note: You must implement exactly like what is described.

## Part 2: Radix Sort
Modify the radix sort algorithm to sort floating point number. The program must be a modification, and not a different implementation or variant of radix sort.

## Part 3: Analysis
Perform complexity analysis on both the algorithms by experiments. Plot a graph: number of operation vs n. Determine the big-O for both algorithms.

## Steps
1. git clone https://github.com/diminecjean/radix-sort.git

3. git commit -m "[COMMIT MESSAGE]"
4. git pull origin main
5. git checkout -b [YOUR-BRANCH] (For newly created)
6. git checkout [YOUR-BRANCH]
7. git push origin [YOUR-BRANCH]
8. Open Pull Request from [YOUR-BRANCH] to main - In github website
